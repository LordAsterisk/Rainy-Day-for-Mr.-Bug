# Rainy Day for Mr. Bug.

A happy ladybug sits unsuspectingly under a storm cloud in this interactive sketch.

Click on the cloud to cause rain to fall down from where you pressed. When the rain hits the ground, it returns back to the cloud to fall once again. Luckily, our spotted hero isn't afraid to get wet. Click on him to watch as he hops up excitedly from his happy, happy day.

To give a stormy-day effect, I decided that it would be cool to have a gradient from dark to light. I wasn't sure how to implement this, but I fiddled around with the code and found that I could drew many lines across the screen and give them each a slightly different colour value to give a gradient effect. I wanted the gradient to be diagonal and was sort of successful with that, but it ended up with the dark colour in the place where I wanted the light colour, and my attempts at using rotate to fix that failed. I ended up using the more simple horizontal gradient. I'll have to play around with that more in the future! I also used my favourite newly discovered feature beginShape(), which I found seems to help me in practically every situation where I'm having trouble making something look right.
