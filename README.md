A happy ladybug sits unsuspectingly under a storm cloud in this interactive sketch.

Click on the cloud to cause rain to fall down from where you pressed. When the rain hits the ground, it returns back to the cloud to fall once again. Luckily, our spotted hero isn't afraid to get wet. Click on him to watch as he hops up excitedly from his happy, happy day.
